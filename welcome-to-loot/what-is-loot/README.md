# ‚ùì What is Loot?

## Loot is a collaborative media project that aims to create a decentralized, infinitely-expansive sci-fantasy universe, rich with stories, games and multi-media.

The Lootverse is a collection of NFT projects, games, art, stories and multimedia backed by an active community of players, builders, artists, writers and creators.

## Loot is a massively-multiplayer experiment in collaborative world building

## We believe Loot can be as meaningful as Star Wars for the next generation of dreamers.

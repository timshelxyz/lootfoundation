# üåç The Lootverse

{% hint style="success" %}
## <mark style="background-color:green;">The "</mark><mark style="background-color:green;">**Lootverse**</mark><mark style="background-color:green;">" refers to the interconnected set of projects built on top of Loot's foundation.</mark>
{% endhint %}

Collectively, these projects make up an infinitely-expansive, yet still loosely-cohesive universe of games, stories, NFTs, art, multimedia, communities and more.

## An Experiment in Decentralized World-Building&#x20;

Loot is unique ‚Äî¬†there is no central team, no central roadmap, no company that backs it. &#x20;

Loot is a decentralized community of builders, creators, artists, writers and players who are building a world, together.

The collection of projects that have been built on top of Loot have come to be known collectively as "**The Lootverse**."

## **"What is Loot vs. what is not?"**

Many projects have also been inspired by Loot to go build in various other directions, which can be confusing.  Some incredibly successfully projects have been inspired to build outside of the Lootverse, including N Project, Dope Wars, Treasure.  The success of these projects reinforce the mysterious power and magic of Loot.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the Loot community, what makes a project "In the Lootverse" = whether the project expands on Loot and advances Loot forward, in concert with the wider Lootverse ecosystem.

# The 16 Orders

Defined in the original Loot contract, there are a set of 16 "Suffixes."

## What do the "Suffixes" mean?

As a community, we have determined that these Suffixes suggest "**Spirits**" within each of the items, and that these Spirits naturally drove the society to organize around "**Orders**" (i.e. groups/factions) of Adventurers who are drawn to the same Spirits.

As the community canon goes:&#x20;

When the original Adventurers (the Genesis Adventurers) discovered the Genesis Loot bags during the Genesis Era, these bags were organized perfectly around items of all the same Spirit / Order.

Since then, the items have been passed down from generation to generation, through peace and in war, and the items "of" various Orders have been shuffled together into the OG Loot and mLoot bags that we now find.

## The Community Has Crafted Definitions for the Meanings of Each Order

_Detailed community-crafted explanations of each of the 16 Orders can be found in the Lore Development Kits_

## Orders have become an organizing principle across the Lootverse and are found in:

* [**Genesis Project**](../../../the-lootverse/lootverse-projects/genesis-project.md) — each Genesis Adventurer belongs to an Order
* [**Realms**](../../../the-lootverse/lootverse-projects/realms-bibliothecadao.md) — each Realm belongs to an Order
* [**Banners**](../../../the-lootverse/lootverse-projects/banners.md) **** — **** each Banner corresponds to an Order
* **Loot Explorers**
* **HyperLoot**
* And more

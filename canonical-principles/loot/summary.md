## Summary of how Loot bags work:

| Topic                 | TLDR                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Item Types**        | Each bag has a Weapon (1) + Armor (5) + Jewelry (2)                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Item Materials**    | <p>All Weapons fit into Bludgeons, Blades, Books &#x26; Wands.<br>All Armor fits into: Metal, Hide, Cloth</p>                                                                                           |
| **Character Classes** | All Weapons and Armor fit into three classes. These three classes have been named by the community: Warrior (Metal), Hunter (Hide), Cloth (Mage)                                                        |
| **Item Levels**       | All items have a relative "level" within their inventory slot and character class. These levels are evident in the contract and range from 1-5 for the Weapons and Armor, and 1-3 for the Jewelry       |
| **Orders**            | There are 16 "Orders" which are thought of as "spirits" and are considered to be the organizing principle around which the ancient societies of Loot were structured, like clans, teams, or "orders".   |
| **Name Prefixes**     | Items with Greatness 19+ get a "Name Prefix" made up of two words.  There exists three "sets" of name prefixes that go together, with no crossover between those sets.                                  |
| **The Missing Names** | One of the Name Prefix sets, while it exists in the Loot contract itself, is never used on any items in Loot (yet...?)                                                                                  |
| **Greatness**         | Each item has a Greatness score, which defines whether it gets an Order (at 15+), a Name Prefix (at 19+), or a +1 (at 20)                                                                               |
| **Rating**            | Every item has a Rating, which is simply its `Greatness x Level`. Each bag has a Rating, which is simply the sum of the Ratings of its eight items.                                                     |
|                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

# Constraint: Orders<>Demons/Dragons Names

These 2 different partitions of names, Demon / Dragon and Odd / Even Orders alliances, cross perfectly and the named items can be split evenly across the following 4 groups, each uniquely identified by 3 different nameSuffixes:

|              | Odd Orders alliance    | Even Orders alliance   |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Demon group  | Bender-Bite-Peak: 1544 | Grasp-Moon-Shout: 1556 |
| Dragon group | Roar-Sun-Whisper: 1510 | Glow-Root-Tear: 1447   |

They delineate 4 clans of named items, each specific to Demon or Dragon forces, and to Odd or Even Orders alliances.

But there is a deeper structure within these 4 clans!&#x20;

Indeed, although we can't identify a generic pattern among mythical named items of different types, relative to the 4 groups described above, it takes zooming in on weapons alone to identify an actual pattern.&#x20;

## The pattern with named weapons is that each nameSuffix uniquely identifies a particular weapon:

Weapons are primary items as they are the first loot type to appear in the contract. They also determine if Mages are Mages of Light or Mages of Dark.&#x20;

| Group                        | Odd Orders alliance                                                                                                             | Even Orders alliance                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Demon group                  | <p>Bender: Long Sword (48) (Hunter)<br>Bite: Maul (56) (Warrior)<br>Peak: Grimoire (59) (Mage of Light)</p>                     | <p>Grasp: Katana (79) (Hunter)<br>Moon: Book (70) (Mage of Light)<br>Shout: Grave Wand (62) (Mage of Dark)</p>            |
| Dragon group                 | <p>Roar: Club (58) (Warrior)<br>Sun: Tome (58) (Mage of Light)<br>Whisper: Ghost Wand (61) (Mage of Dark)</p>                   | <p>Glow: Scimitar (49) (Hunter)<br>Root: Quarterstaff (59) (Warrior)<br>Tear: Wand (69) (Mage of Dark)</p>                |
| _Undiscovered Phoenix group_ | <p><em>Bane: Warhammer (Warrior)</em><br><em>Instrument: Falchion (Hunter)</em><br><em>Growl: Bone Wand (Mage of Dark)</em></p> | <p><em>Song: Mace (Warrior)</em><br><em>Shadow: Short Sword (Hunter)</em><br><em>Form: Chronicle (Mage of Light)</em></p> |

A notable element there is that within each discovered group, there is one and only one Adventurer class for which there aren't any named weapon. This remains with the additional two undiscovered Phoenix group, to the exception of the two categories of Mages as can be seen in the above table.

Also note that there are no named Warrior weapons of value 1 (warhammers), in the existing named items. Warhammers come only as generic items (287 of them) or as genesis items (121).

# The "Missing" Name Prefixes

## The Missing Names: "Lore C"

*   Exactly **one third** of name prefixes, even though they are in the original Loot contract, will never **** be added to items because of how the contract code itself works.


* Since there is no level of greatness where lore C is assigned, namePrefixes and nameSuffixes in lore C **can never and will never be assigned to any item**.
  * Which begs the question: _what happened to lore C?_
  * Is there a missing, higher level of greatness?  (Greatness 21+)
  * Did something happen to cause this in the story of the Lootverse?
  * Are these names "from the future?"\

* The highlighted "Lore C" 23 namePrefixes and 6 nameSuffixes below will never show up on any Loot items.
* They simply don't exist and will never exist, even if you looked through infinite Loot bags.

## An accident...or by design?

* The way the contract is built suggests that this was planned on purpose, leaving a third group of names undiscovered yet. Indeed, considering that:
  * Randomizing perfectly the name generation to make sure all 69 namePrefixes and 18 nameSuffixes were used would have been a simple thing to do (e.g. by putting the threshold of greatness at 18 or 21; or by drawing another random number instead of reusing the same one)
  * The supplies of namePrefixes and nameSuffixes, respectively 69 and 18, were obviously chosen to be multiples of 3 (we can notice here that namePrefixes #68 and #69 are the only ones not in alphabetical order - they might have been added afterwards to match 69 exactly)
  * From there, we assume it was done on purpose!&#x20;
  * Under that hypothesis, we can imagine that there are lost names or lost items.&#x20;
  * For example, a next level of greatness that has not bee reached yet?

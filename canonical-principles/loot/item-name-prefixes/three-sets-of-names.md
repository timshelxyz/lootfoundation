# Three "Sets" of Names

## There are three "sets" of name prefixes defined by the original Loot contract <a href="#block-ae31179b85944423afa74087fd7378f6" id="block-ae31179b85944423afa74087fd7378f6"></a>

* It has emerged that namePrefixes and nameSuffixes appear together in three distinct sets. In the below image these three sets have been termed as “lores”:

*   **Every Loot item is assigned with a level of greatness ranging between 0 and 20.**&#x20;

    ****
* **Whether the namePrefixes and nameSuffixes are picked out from lore A, B or C is determined by the item’s level of greatness.**
  * Items with a greatness of 0-18 are not prescribed with any Item Names
  * Items with Greatness = 19 are prescribed only with lore A&#x20;
  * Items with Greatness = 20 are prescribed only with lore B
  * Items with Greatnes = 21 WOULD be prescribed with lore C...but the contract caps Greatness at 20

## This leads us to the "Missing Names" often referred to as Lore C

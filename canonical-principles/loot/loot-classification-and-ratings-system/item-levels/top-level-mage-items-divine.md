# Top Level Mage Items: Divine

In the Loot contract, Divine items play a special role.

There are 4 Loot items that use the word "Divine."  All items belong to the lightest weight class, generally classed as [c-mages.md](../character-classes-specialties/c-mages.md "mention").&#x20;

All except one are the highest level items in their respective item classes.

**Divine Robe** (Level 5 Mage Chest)\
**Divine Slippers** (Level 5 Mage Feet)\
**Divine Gloves** (Level 5 Mage Hands)\
**Divine Hood** (Level 4 Mage Head, second only to Crowns)

The fact that these items are described by a word - "Divine" - and not a material, plus the fact that they're the highest ranked items for their item classes, suggests these are special items that may be attuned to a higher power.

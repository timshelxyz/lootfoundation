# Character Classes / Specialties

### There are three "Character Classes" of Loot items, hidden in the original Loot contract. <a href="#block-69de0147523844be84bcf08626d8fcf6" id="block-69de0147523844be84bcf08626d8fcf6"></a>

These are like "specialties" — clear groupings of what each item type is meant to be used for. The community has colloquially begun to refer to these as "Character Classes."

### Class A <a href="#block-69de0147523844be84bcf08626d8fcf6" id="block-69de0147523844be84bcf08626d8fcf6"></a>

Adventurers of Class A wear **Heavy Metal Armor** and wield **Bludgeons**.

### **Class B** <a href="#block-55e5f6979ec84e998ff2d6a3ab640fe1" id="block-55e5f6979ec84e998ff2d6a3ab640fe1"></a>

Adventurers of Class B wear **Medium Hide Armor** and wield **Swords**.&#x20;

They carry items that tell the stories of the Dragons and Demons they’ve encountered.

### **Class C** <a href="#block-eaa064cc2fa545f0a561b452235f6f5e" id="block-eaa064cc2fa545f0a561b452235f6f5e"></a>

Adventurers of Class C wear **Cloth** attire and wield two types of weapons: **Books and Wands**.&#x20;

The Books are attuned to Light magic and the Wands are attuned to Dark.

# ðŸ‘‹ Intro to Loot.foundation

## Loot.foundation is designed for builders, developers, designers and storytellers who want to build a cohesive Lootverse, together.

As builders develop on top of a unified foundation underpinned by a shared set of physics and core principles, the Lootverse will feel like a cohesive universe connected by a set of intertwined games, lore, art, and stories that collectively enrich and advance each other.

From a cohesive foundation, we can build an infinitely-expansive universe.

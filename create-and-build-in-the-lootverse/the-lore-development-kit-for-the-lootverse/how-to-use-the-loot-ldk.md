# How to Use the Loot LDK

If your goal is to weave a story or a project into the existing Loot canon in a way that builds on top of the existing universe, we recommend **familiarizing yourself with the LDK and consciously choosing a point of entry into the Lootverse.**

Anyone is welcome to create content or projects that contradict the foundational canon of the Lootverse, but we'd recommend (and even request?) that if you do create content that directly undermines or contradicts the original Loot contract or the existing Loot canon, that you do so _intentionally and with purpose_.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Loot is wide open and fully CC0, so anyone is welcome to do anything with Loot.

But Loot is more than just white text on a black screen.

Loot is more than just a jumbled list of fantasy words.

Loot _does_ have order, meaning, and structure.

Loot _does_ have canon, hidden in the contract itself.

And Loot _does_ now have a community-crafted interpretation that serves as a rich foundation for infinite expansion through stories, projects, games, and more.

**Everyone is invited to advance the Lootverse forward, together.**

### Let's build an infinitely-expansive, yet still-cohesive Lootverse together.

# Guiding Principles for the LDK

B**ased on the canonical principles of Loot, the LDK should provide scaffolding in order to help bring the Lootverse to life**

* Stories and projects built on top of the LDK should not fundamentally contradict the core canonical principles of Loot (unless it is very, very intentional)

**The LDK should provide an internally-consistent and fundamentally sound baseline for Lootverse stories/projects to build on**

* Each story/project does not need to be consistent with the other stories/projects, but they should not contradict the core foundations of Loot

**An LDK should invite collaboration and expansion.**

* An LDK should act as a scaffolding for stories, with just enough constraint so as to provide creative inspiration and loose cohesion.

**As new facts and stories and projects unfold, the LDK is free to evolve.**

* If a fundamental fact in an LDK changes, the LDK curator(s) should provide release notes and/or an update to the projects that are building on top of their LDK.

**For creators** — if you do create content that directly undermines or contradicts the LDK and core canon, please be sure to do so _intentionally and with purpose_. And ideally, suggest an update to the LDK that can advance the foundational canon forward for everyone.

# ðŸ§° The "Lore Development Kit" for the Lootverse

{% hint style="info" %}
The "**Lore Development Kit**" provides the foundational elements that enable creators, builders, artists and writers to build a cohesive, yet infinitely-expansive universe, together.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

As a community, weâ€™ve begun to build our own interpretations of the **foundational basics of the Lootverse** â€”Â the meaning of the items, the implications of the canon hidden in the contract, and what this implies about the past, present and future of the Lootverse.

Miraculously, these interpretations have coalesced into a single, cohesive worldview.

{% hint style="success" %}
We call this a "**Lore Development Kit**" (LDK) â€”Â a set of foundational principles and physics that act as a scaffolding for the development of infinite stories.
{% endhint %}

Over time, we imagine that others will come along and completely re-imagine the meaning of the items and the timeline they imply. Loot is open to all, so we welcome this explosion of creativity.

To help creators and builders work together in the face of potential chaos, we recommend that projects who decide to depart from the existing LDK build their _own_ structured LDK.

From a structured LDK, artists, writers, creators and builders can work together to breath life into the Lootverse.

Think of a Lore Development Kit like a Software Development Kit â€”Â a structured set of information, functions, documentation and principles that enable the collaborative creation of a shared, interoperable universe.

## Welcome to Loot's Lore Development Kit

{% hint style="success" %}
This is the first LDK: a distillation of months of work from the community and thousands of hours of debate, contract study, and world-building.

# What's in the LDK?

{% hint style="info" %}
A "Lore Development Kit" provides the foundational elements that enable creators, builders, artists and writers to build a cohesive, yet infinitely-expansive universe, together.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Loot's Lore Development Kit:

1. Defines **fundamentals** like "What is Loot?" and "Who are we?"
2. Provides expanded **definitions** for the core Loot principles like Orders, Greatness, item names
3. Lays out a **timeline** for the Lootverse, like an open-ended scaffolding for stories.
   * The LDK can also provide seeds of stories that can be built on top of that scaffolding.

# A Short History of the Divine City

## The Pulse

Sometime in the late [Genesis Era](../../../a-meta-timeline-of-the-lootverse/a-visual-timeline-of-the-eras-of-the-lootverse/the-genesis-era.md), two [mages](../../../../canonical-principles/loot/loot-classification-and-ratings-system/character-classes-specialties/c-mages.md) were removed from their villages and exiled into the wildest, most southern reaches of the Realms. They roamed for years, traveling from remote town to remote town. They became mercenary mages. Earned reputations as legendary alchemists.

One day they came across a third mage – the first mage they had seen in years. This mage was on a mission to find what she called The Pulse – a mysterious source of magical energy felt by all mages across the Realms. _Why was so much power concentrated here?_

The mercenary mages joined this mage on a dangerous quest to find The Pulse.

Sometime unknown time later, the three mages found it in a place called Origin Oasis. The Pulse was a massive hole in the ground, reaching all the way down to the world-core.

## Experimental Period

The mages quickly realized they could tap into the world-core’s geothermal energy, and supercharge their alchemic abilities to impossible levels, beyond comprehension.

They called it Divine Energy.

They formed an order – Divine Order of Robes – whose mission was to experiment with the energy source. During this period, the Divine Order of Robes – or D.O.O.R. – went out into the Realms to recruit the best mages and alchemists away from their villages.

Not much is known about the experiments done here in the early years.

## Founding The City

So many mages had started to make secret expeditions to The Pulse (most of them staying there for extended periods) that a small village was constructed.

D.O.O.R. continued to recruit the best and brightest mages, and the village grew into a city.

People of the Realms started to get curious. _Where were all the mages disappearing to?_ Rumors spread about a secret society. Conspiracies abounded.

D.O.O.R. decided to take measures to protect The Pulse, to make sure it didn’t get discovered or taken over by someone or some group with malevolent intentions.

They built an altar around it. Cast spells to hide it from plain sight. Recruited Guardians to protect it. Fortified the city around it.

## The Second Pulse

At some point during the [Age of Exploration](../../../a-meta-timeline-of-the-lootverse/a-visual-timeline-of-the-eras-of-the-lootverse/the-age-of-exploration.md), a second Pulse was found by non-mages.

D.O.O.R. attacked and took control of The Second Pulse, kicking off decades of counter-attacks and wars for control over this second source of Divine Energy.

## The Rising of the Divine City

The history is unclear, but legend has it that the Divine City was surprise-attacked by a massive, unified force of armies from across the Realms, spanning all [16 orders](../../the-16-orders/).

Despite the city's fortifications and shields powered by Divine Energy, the Mage’s could not hold off the attack.

Fearing the city would be lost, and Divine Energy would be taken out of their control, the Mage’s within the city used an impossible amount of Divine Energy to raise the city into the sky – this destabilized the world-core, triggering an event know to this day as _The Cataclysm_.

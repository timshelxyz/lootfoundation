Floating in the sky, and built out of a single piece of rock. The Divine City was founded by a secret society called D.O.O.R. during [The Age of Exploration](../../../a-meta-timeline-of-the-lootverse/a-visual-timeline-of-the-eras-of-the-lootverse/the-age-of-exploration.md).

Millennia later, long after the Cataclysm, and near the end of [the Age of Mist and Shadow](../../../a-meta-timeline-of-the-lootverse/a-visual-timeline-of-the-eras-of-the-lootverse/the-mist.md), The Divine City was discovered by a band of explorers. _They found it empty._

We do not yet know the cities true name.

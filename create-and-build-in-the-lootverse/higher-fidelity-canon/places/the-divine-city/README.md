The Divine City started as a settlement, then became a village, then a small, town and finally a city. All of this growth took place during the Age of Exploration.

<summary>Why was the Divine City built?</summary>

The original settlement was established as an Area 51-type research center. A group of mages found this massive hole in the ground, an energy source they called "Origin."

They formed an order – Divine Order of Robes – whose mission was to experiment with the energy source. During this period, the Divine Order of Robes – or D.O.O.R. – went out into the Realms to recruit the best mages and alchemists away from their villages.

So many mages made secret expeditions to Origin (most of them staying there for extended periods) that a small village was constructed.

D.O.O.R. continued to recruit the best and brightest, and the village grew into a city.

# ðŸ’® The 16 Orders

Defined in the original Loot contract, there are a set of 16 "Suffixes."

As a community, we have determined that this Suffixes are in fact "Orders" or groups/factions. &#x20;

These Orders existed during the "Genesis Era" of the Lootverse and were the organizing principle around which the "Genesis Adventurers" were formed. &#x20;

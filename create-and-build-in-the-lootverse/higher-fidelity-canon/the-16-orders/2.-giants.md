# 2. Giants

The Order of Giants values physical might, not just to crush their foes, but as the backbone of the great constructions in the Realms, their strength making them invaluable to Builders.&#x20;

Their size also makes them vulnerable to faster and smaller opponents and their leaders often win their position through combat prowess, which has led to a culture of poor strategic decisions in preference of displaying their full strength.

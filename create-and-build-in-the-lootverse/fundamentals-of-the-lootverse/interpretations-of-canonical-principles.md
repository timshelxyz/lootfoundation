<summary><mark style="background-color:orange;">Greatness</mark> Grows with Time &#x26; Experience</summary>

The greatness of an item is not fixed.&#x20;

The greatness grows with time and experience.&#x20;

When an item is first created, it begins with Greatness 0 and thus no "fresh" items have any name prefixes or suffixes. Therefore when the Genesis Loot bags were discovered, all of the items were Greatness 0 and did not yet have any name prefixes or suffixes (Orders).

As Adventurers use items in battles, conflicts, adventures and quests, the Greatness of those items grows.

As such, the items in the [OG Loot](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/og-loot.md) bags with the highest Greatness (15+) are the _oldest_ items, which once belonged to the [Genesis Adventurers](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/genesis-loot.md).

Even today, most items start with Greatness 0 and grow with age/time/experience, though some master craftsman can create items with higher starting Greatness.

<summary>Items with "Names" Carry <mark style="background-color:green;">Enchantments</mark></summary>

Each name is an "Enchantment"&#x20;

As defined in the original Loot contract, the names attached to some items are in fact two independent variables, put together onto the item.

These independent variables are each "Enchantments."&#x20;

Where these Enchantments came from and what they mean is still unclear, but what we do know is: when items reach Greatness 19 through experience and age, they become more powerful and "enchanted" with these names.&#x20;

The meaning of the item names is a mystery, and the stories of each of the enchantments is open for interpretation.

<summary>Each Loot Item is Infused with One of the Order's "<mark style="background-color:blue;">Spirits</mark>" and That Spirit Grows Stronger with Age and Experience </summary>

Each of the Loot items is infused with one of 16 Spirits at creation {Power, Giants, Titans, etc}. This later becomes known as [the-16-orders](../../canonical-principles/loot/the-16-orders/ "mention")

At creation, this Spirit is hidden inside the item, not yet revealed as a name on the item itself.

As the Greatness of an item increases with experience so does the power of the Spirit infused in it.&#x20;

When the item reaches Greatness 15, the power of the Spirit is strong enough to visually alter the item making its "Order" / Spirit recognizable to all.

From the Loot contract itself, it is possible to detect the Spirit of an item as soon as it is created, with it becoming increasingly easier at higher Greatness levels and then unquestionable at greatness 15 when it is publicly printed onto the item's name.&#x20;

Note that this is simply how the Loot contract works â€”Â Given a bag ID + an item name, the "Order" is deterministic, even if the Greatness is <15.



**In context:**

* During the Genesis Era, the [genesis-loot.md](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/genesis-loot.md "mention") bags were discovered.

<!---->

* When they were discovered, all items were at Greatness 0 and therefore had no "name" prefixes or Order suffixes.&#x20;

<!---->

* With time and usage, these items grew in Greatness and revealed their true names.

<!---->

* Through the discovery of the "Orders" hidden inside the items and the "Spirits" of those Orders, a cultural and societal alignment happened whereby adventurers organized into groups defined by these 16 Orders/Spirits.

<summary>The <mark style="background-color:purple;">16 Orders</mark> Represent Societal Structures Formed Around "Spirits" and Alignments</summary>

The 16 Orders emerged as a societal structure,  a reaction to the discovery of the special powers and "spirits" of the items when they reached Greatness 15.

Adventurers of the 16 Orders each banded together across different areas of the Realms.&#x20;

â€”> [the-lootverse-atlas.md](../../the-lootverse/the-lootverse-atlas.md "mention")

The early Orders worshipped the [Genesis Loot](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/genesis-loot.md) bags, the first 2,540 Loot bags which were filled with all items of a single spirit / single Order.

<summary>Citizens of the Lootverse Can Create Items, But NOT Items Infused with Spirits/Orders/Names</summary>

The citizens of the Lootverse _can_ make katanas, robes, chain mail, etc.

_**But**_ â€” they cannot infuse these items with a Spirit, which is what makes the actual "Loot" items unique and powerful.

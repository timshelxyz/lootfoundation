<summary>What is Loot?</summary>

* Loot is a set of gear worn by Adventurers
* A Loot bag ‚â† an Adventurer
* A Loot bag = the items and gear carried by an Adventurer.
* Loot bags always have 8 items, one to equip each inventory slot (see [item-types.md](../../canonical-principles/loot/loot-classification-and-ratings-system/item-types.md "mention")).

<!---->

* While Loot came with no website, no instruction manual, no stats sheet, no game, no stories, no characters, nothing...Loot _does_ have a rich canon hidden in plain sight inside the contract itself.
* Inside each bag, inside each item, and inside the original Loot contract, there are clues and hints of ancient stories and past adventures, a hidden structure and order to the world.

<!---->

* **An implied timeline:**
  * Because these Loot items were found in bags, and not on characters, it implies a history and a [timeline](../a-meta-timeline-of-the-lootverse/a-visual-timeline-of-the-eras-of-the-lootverse/) that predates the 8/27/2021 ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù of the 8k Loot bags.
  * Because the 8,000 [og-loot.md](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/og-loot.md "mention") bags were filled with randomized items, it implies that there was once order and structure, and that there was once a set of "perfect" and original bags, long long ago.&#x20;
  * In the "[timeline](../a-meta-timeline-of-the-lootverse/a-visual-timeline-of-the-eras-of-the-lootverse/) of Loot," the earliest known Loot bags are widely considered to be the 2,540 [genesis-loot.md](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/genesis-loot.md "mention") bags. &#x20;
    * The items in the OG Loot bags _came_ from these Genesis Loot bags and a set of other Loot bags discovered over time. &#x20;
    * The items from all of these historical Loot bags have been passed down across generations, which is why the 8,000 [og-loot.md](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/og-loot.md "mention") bags that we all found on 8/28/2022 are full of mixed up items.
    * From these mixed up items, though, it is abundantly clear that Loot is not random ‚Äî the structure of the bags and the contract hint at ancient stories and a multi-epoch timeline for us to re-discover.

<summary>What is an Adventurer?</summary>

* An Adventurer is a character who carries this gear, owns these items and uses them for quests, battles, exploration and adventures.
* By donning this gear that we've found in these Loot bags, we can follow in the footsteps of our ancestors and _become_ Adventurers

<summary>Where did Loot come from?</summary>

<mark style="color:red;">**In real life:**</mark>&#x20;

* _<mark style="color:red;">Loot was a free mint on Etherscan, an unexpected discovery of 8,000 Loot bags...which has drawn together a community of builders, collectors, storytellers, investors, artists, designers, and more, all collectively-inspired to build a decentralized world together.</mark>_

**In Lootverse lore that lines up with our real life experience:**&#x20;

* Loot was _discovered_ in bags, its meaning and purpose unclear.  \

* We do not know how it was found or where it came from, but we do know some things about the nature of what was in those original bags.

<!---->

* We believe that the earliest known Loot bags ‚Äî¬†**"**[**Genesis Loot**](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/genesis-loot.md)**" bags ‚Äî¬†were discovered (mirroring our own experience), and then given to 2,540 individual people who opened them up with wonder and intrigue**.
  * Inside the bags, eight items, all seemingly "normal."
  * But they could tell that something was special.
  * They did not know this yet, but these items all contained the same spirit ‚Äî a spirit that would later shape the very fabric of society (the 16 Orders)
  * `Technical note: each time a Loot bag is discovered, each of the items begins at Greatness 0. Over time, with experience and age, Greatness grows.  As as Greatness reaches 15-20, the true nature of the items reveal themselves (Orders, Names, +1).`
  * These early adventurers ("Genesis Adventurers") and the societies around them were deeply entranced by the Loot bags ‚Äî¬†triggering the first cycle of discovery, inspection, revelation, teamwork, building, and adventure...¬†

<!---->

* **Over the course of thousands of years and generations upon generations, the rest of the 8,000 "**[**OG Loot**](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/og-loot.md)**" bags were discovered** **by individuals who also opened them up with wonder and intrigue.**
  * With each new discovery, another cycle began: discovery, inspection, revelation, teamwork, building, and adventure...¬†

<!---->

* And then something cataclysmic happened ‚Äî¬†nearly all life ceased, only some people remained, and the bags were left hidden and forgotten for generations.
* For generations, a group of wanderers scoured the land, searching for meaning, turning over rocks and opening ancient caverns, looking for hidden treasures...
* And then ‚Äî¬†[**8/27/2022**](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1fe3eed7d7e753819b662a09a5eaaa162724d64d6585923018c63567fa177d22)****

<mark style="color:red;">**In real life:**</mark>

* <mark style="color:red;">When we discovered the 8,000</mark> [og-loot.md](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/og-loot.md "mention") <mark style="color:red;">bags and minted them from Etherscan, there were no signs of other life.</mark> &#x20;
* <mark style="color:red;">No characters, no quests, no stories, no games, no website, nothing...</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">Minting the bags from Etherscan was like pulling them out of the mist, and it filled us with wonder and intrigue.</mark>

**In Lootverse lore, that is in fact also our real life experience:**

* And then on 8/27/2021, a group of wanderers/explorers came across a cache of 8,000 [og-loot.md](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/og-loot.md "mention") bags.
  * ...those wanderers are US.
* Thus we begin our _own_ cycle of discovery, revelation, teamwork, building and adventure.
* We follow in the footsteps of our ancestors ‚Äî¬†inspecting the bags, making sense of the bags, finding meaning in the bags. &#x20;
* We're drawn to use the bags as a foundation for building.
* We're drawn to distilling items from the bags.
* And ultimately, we're drawn to use the Loot we found to go on the quests and adventures that lie ahead....

<summary>Who are we?</summary>

* We are travelers, wanderers, explorers...who have discovered thousands of bags of Loot, discarded under bridges and in the dirt and buried under layers of ruin.

<!---->

* We _descend_ from Adventurers

<!---->

* And with these Loot bags, we are now _becoming_ Adventurers....following in the footsteps of our Lootverse ancestors.

<!---->

* With these bags, and with the tools to build and the clues and mysteries that are unfolding around us, we may don this gear and _become_ adventurers...following in the footsteps of our ancestors.

<!---->

* In the ‚Äúpast‚Äù on the timeline, we can play games as Adventurers, we can see the world through their eyes, and we can recreate their experiences

<!---->

* From the Genesis Era, to The Great War to the Mist...there are infinite stories to be told, of quests, of battles, of raids, of wars, of love and of loss.

<!---->

* When we step into the past, we are stepping into the shoes of our ancestors who carried this Loot (for Adventurers) and we are reliving their experiences ‚Äî and through those experiences, we are also rediscovering our own past and our own purpose.

<summary>What is the "story" of Loot?</summary>

**The story of Loot is a story of discovery, revelation, teamwork, building, and adventure.  A story of decentralized action and collaborative world-building, across thousands of generations and millions of adventurers.**

Loot's meta-story (what we are doing with Loot in reality) is itself _part_ of the Loot story.&#x20;

* As we (in real life) have discovered Loot and are working together to derive meaning and purpose from it, so too did our ancestors when they discovered the original Loot bags in their times.
* As we work together to derive meaning, build games, go on quests, craft characters and discover lore, that act of collaborative creation is itself part of the Loot story.
* When we build a Genesis Adventurer, or design the Realms game, or mint a Crypt or a Cavern, or discuss the meaning of the 16 Orders, or write a story, we are not outsiders looking in as observers.  We are not game-masters working outside of Loot.  We are in fact working _in_ the world of Loot, acting as Adventurers ourselves.
* The story of Loot is one of discovery, collaboration, and a quintessentially-human quest to derive meaning and purpose in the world.

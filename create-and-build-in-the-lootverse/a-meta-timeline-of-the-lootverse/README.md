# ‚è≥ A Meta-Timeline of the Lootverse

{% hint style="info" %}
The following timeline is a "scaffolding" upon which writers/builders/artists can create infinite stories.
{% endhint %}

#### This timeline is derived from two guiding principles:

1. Stay as close as possible to the facts implied by the original OG Loot contract.
2. Mirror the "real life" reality of _our_ collective experience discovering Loot, trading Loot, finding meaning in Loot, and collaboratively-building the Lootverse together.

## A Meta-Timeline of the Lootverse

The history of the Lootverse before the discovery of the first set of Loot bags is unknown.

* People find 2,540 bags of [genesis-loot.md](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/genesis-loot.md "mention").&#x20;
  * Note that in _real life_, we found [OG Loot](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/og-loot.md) first (8k randomized bags of Loot), and from [OG Loot](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/og-loot.md) we derived the concept of [Genesis Loot](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/genesis-loot.md) (2540 original, perfectly-organized bags). &#x20;
  * But in the _story-world timeline_, the Genesis Loot came first, organized around the 16 Orders, and then devolved into randomness over time. Read on from here to see how that makes sense. :)
* "What are these magical bags?!" -> There is a **frenzy**.
* People **learn** about the bags.
* As they learn, they **trade, cherish, and protect** the bags.
* This learning leads to an **epiphany, a revelation**.
* Driven by that revelation, they begin to **build**...
* Adorned with the items from the bags, the **Adventurers set out on quests and adventures...**
* Across generations, there is peace and war, birth and death, the rise and fall of societies, explorations and discoveries, demons and dragons, kings and queens, and everything imaginable.
* Over time, the magically-powerful Loot items are passed from father to son, from mother to daughter, from brother to brother, mixed all together and revered.

<summary>The Age of Exploration (Cycle 2) ‚Äî  <mark style="background-color:orange;">The Past</mark></summary>

*   Over time, people find additional bags of Loot. &#x20;

    \
    _üîé  This Loot plus the_ [_**Genesis Loot**_](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/genesis-loot.md) _discovered in the Genesis Era combine to make up what_ **we** _will later will discover and refer to as_ [og-loot.md](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/og-loot.md "mention")

<!---->

* There is a frenzy.
* People learn about the bags.
* As they learn, they trade, cherish, and protect the bags.
* This learning leads to an epiphany, a revelation.

<!---->

* One major revelation during The Age of Exploration:
  * As the Loot items cross into Greatness 15 and up, Adventurers discover the existence of [the-16-orders](../../canonical-principles/loot/the-16-orders/ "mention") and the [item-name-prefixes](../../canonical-principles/loot/item-name-prefixes/ "mention")
  * This marks a monumental shift in society.

<!---->

* Driven by that revelation, they begin to build and advance...

<!---->

* Adorned with these additional items from the bags mixed with the items already circulating, the Adventurers explore. They set out on quests.  They go on adventures...

_`üé® This Age of Exploration is a wide open canvas for creativity and storytelling.`_

* Across further generations, there is continued peace and war, birth and death, the rise and fall of societies, explorations and discoveries, demons and dragons, kings and queens, and everything imaginable.

<!---->

* Over time, all of these magically-powerful Loot items are passed from father to son, from mother to daughter, from brother to brother, mixed all together and revered.

<!---->

* But something goes wrong ‚Äî¬†there is some sort of major **cataclysm**.&#x20;
* We don't know what, but what we know is that time stands still and nearly all life stops in its tracks.

_`üé® This cataclysmic event is a wide open canvas for creativity and storytelling.`_

<summary>The Mist (An Interlude) ‚Äî¬†<mark style="background-color:orange;">The Quiet Period Before WE Entered the Lootverse</mark></summary>

* There is desolation across the Realms.
* The Mist swirls.
* 8,000 Loot Bags, hidden in crypts and caverns across the Realms.
* A few lone groups of travelers survive.
* Some take shelter in the Divine City, safeguarding the stories and art and history of the Lootverse with desperate dreams that a future generation will rebuild.
* Others continue to wander, searching for clues.
* Generations pass.
* Small groups continue their search for meaning and purpose across the desolate realms.
* There are stories, myths, legends passed down....no one knows what is fact or fiction.

_`üé® This Era of The Mist is a wide open canvas for creativity and storytelling.`_

* And then...a discovery: WE find 8,000 [og-loot.md](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/og-loot.md "mention") bags scattered across the Realms. &#x20;

_`üé® This moment of the discovery of the 8,000 original "OG" Loot bags is a wide open canvas for creativity and storytelling.  This is the moment when "we" enter the story in the present day, from the first Loot bag minted from Etherscan on 8/27/2021.`_

<summary>The Age of Adventure (Cycle 3) ‚Äî¬†<mark style="background-color:green;">Present Day &#x26; the Future</mark></summary>

* We find 8k bags of [og-loot.md](../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/og-loot.md "mention") _(In real life and in the story itself.)_
* There is a **frenzy**. _(And there surely was!)_
* We **learn** about the bags. _(And we did...)_
* As we learn, we **trade, cherish, and protect** the bags. _(As we are...)_

<!---->

* **This learning leads to an epiphany**: there is intentional structure hidden right in the contract!
  * 16 Orders!
  * The existence of the Genesis Adventurers!
  * Item levels!
  * Three Character Classes / item specializations!
  * The names!
  * Greatness!
  * Lore A/B/C!

<!---->

* Driven by that epiphany and our collective inspiration and energy, we are working together to **build the Lootverse**

<!---->

* And soon, armed with the items from our Loot bags, WE have begun to set out on quests and adventures...and just like those who came before us, we have become **Adventurers** again.

_`üé® This Age of Adventure is a wide open canvas for creativity and storytelling, representing everything that's happened since we found the OG Loot bags on 8/27/2021 and everything that we will develop and discover in the bright future ahead...`_

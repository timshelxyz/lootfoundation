# The Mist

## Lonely groups of wandering travelers, searching for meaning in the Mist, telling tales by firelight to pass down ancient lore and the stories of their ancestors.

What is fact and fiction intertwined, and what was left were just stories passed down across generations.

These Travelers wandered for generations, on the open road, searching for clues and keys to rebuild the world lost by their ancestors.

Were the stories they carried legend or truth? Myths or reality?

They wandered and searched, sometimes alone, sometimes banded together to take shelter from the Mist.

**`The Mist Era is a wide open canvas for creative storytelling`**

`These wandering travelers are, of course, a metaphor for US, searching for meaning in web3/blockchain/life itself… before the discovery of the 8k Loot bags`
{% endhint %}

## And then, a discovery

And then….**on one misty evening, August 28th 2021, an adventurer came across a single Loot bag lying in the dust** and looked inside — a katana? A divine robe? A chronicle?&#x20;

* He had only heard legends of these items…but in fact, here they were, real.
* He looked around: could he just pick them up and take them? Were there more?&#x20;
* He called over the group (US!) and we scoured the land…and discovered a total of 8,000 bags that first day.&#x20;
* In a chaotic next week, we traded the bags back and forth for resources, knowing there was something special inside them, but not yet sure what.

And, like our ancestors generations ago, **we began to inspect the items, looking for clues, searching for meaning and opportunity.**

The Mist continued to swirl.

## With these bags on their backs, we continued to wander, beginning to find each other through the Mist.

**Stories and visions began to come to us**….visions of cities to build, crypts to raid, dungeons to crawl, dragons to slay, etc….there was something new in the air.

_This is a metaphor for all of the early building inside of the Lootverse, the stops and starts and visions._
{% endhint %}

....we could feel that end of the Mist Era was soon at hand and something new was emerging.

## The Discovery of the Divine City

And then one day, a small group of travelers wandered into a moss-covered valley and looked up at the sky….in the clouds, a city…”**the Divine City…it’s real**! The stories are true!”

They tributed their bags, worked together, and opened the gates.&#x20;

Inside, they began to find snippets and stories and clues about their past — lore, compendiums, librariums, and more.

{% hint style="info" %}
`This is a powerful story device that allows us to actively "discover" content, stories, and multimedia that has been "safeguarded" in the Divine Library.`\
``\
`This construct of a Divine Library allows for infinite creative space: fictional narratives, nonfiction stories of the past, compendiums of items, bestiaries, scraps of lost letters, etc, etc, etc.`
{% endhint %}

With these new stories and clues and mysteries….the wandering travelers (us) began to find the seeds of the “meaning” that we'd been looking for for generations.

And we began to build...and together, to go on quests and adventures.

_Thus marks the end of the Mist_

## _And thus begins the Age of Adventure:_ from today to the infinite future, as we all build together

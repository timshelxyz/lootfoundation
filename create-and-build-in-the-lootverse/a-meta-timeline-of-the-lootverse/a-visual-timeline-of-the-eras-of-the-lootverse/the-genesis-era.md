# The Genesis Era

The Genesis Era represents the earliest recorded history of the Lootverse.&#x20;

Its history is incomplete, but legends and myths and stories have been passed down through generations.

## **What we know:**

These original Adventures wore and used simple items like books and helms and linen and wool and basic swords and weapons. &#x20;

They lived in cities and villages across the Realms.

They built dungeons; they hid their treasures in crypts and caverns; they traveled the world, exploring.

They built castles, allegiances, farms — in short, **they built a thriving society**.

## **As the legend goes:**

* One day, a single bag was discovered by a lone traveler — maybe in a cave, or a crypt, or a cavern, or just simply discarded by the side of a road.\

* Inside this bag, a collection of items: weapons, armor, jewelry.  \

* These items seemed similar to the regular items worn by people, but **something was different.** \

* They shimmered with magic and possibility and buzzed with energy. \

* Then more bags began to emerge across the Realms, imbued with the same magic and similarly locked — 10, then 100, then 500, until 2,540 "bags of Loot" were discovered in total. \

* **The questions spread through the Realms:**

> Where did this Loot come from?
>
> What is the meaning of these items?
>
> Why only 2,540?
>
> What are we meant to do with these bags of Loot?

There were more questions than answers.

## Today, we call these the **"**[**Genesis Loot**](../../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/genesis-loot.md)**" bags** — the first 2,540 bags of Loot discovered across the Realms.&#x20;

* Adorned with the items from the bags, the **Adventurers set out on quests and adventures...**
* Across generations, there is peace and war, birth and death, the rise and fall of societies, explorations and discoveries, demons and dragons, kings and queens, and everything imaginable.
* Over time, the magically-powerful Loot items are passed from father to son, from mother to daughter, from brother to brother, mixed all together and revered.

## Over time, as these items were used in peace and in war, **the items began to grow in Greatness.**

* With each generation, these special items continued to feel unique and different, imbued with some sort of "spirit" or powers waiting to be revealed_`.`_
* As the Greatness grew, the spirits and powers inside the items grew stronger.
* A magnetic pull, too faint to put a finger on, but just present enough that the Genesis Adventurers began to notice it.&#x20;
* They did not understand, but a seed was planted in their minds....

## And then, the discovery of additional Loot bags

## _This marks the end of the Genesis Era:_

* A society abuzz with excitement and hope.
* The beginnings of a societal change, slowly emerging.
* The spark of adventure and exploration seeded in hearts and minds across the Realms.

## _Thus begins The Age of Exploration_

# The Age of Exploration

_The details of the Age of Exploration are still unknown, but we have seen the scars on the items and have heard stories passed down through generations, myths, legends and truths all mixed together._&#x20;

## **Echoing the stories of their ancestors, the Adventurers began to discover new caches of Loot bags**

Over time, people discover additional bags of "Loot," hidden in crypts and caverns, stashed away in demon lairs and dragon caves, buried under piles of ruin.

{% hint style="info" %}
_`üîé This Loot plus the`_ [_**`Genesis Loot`**_](../../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/genesis-loot.md) _`discovered in the Genesis Era combine to make up what`` `**`we`**` ``will later will discover and refer to as`_ [og-loot.md](../../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/og-loot.md "mention")_``_
{% endhint %}

As they inspected the bags, their actions echoed the stories of the past.

Loot bags, discovered across the Realms, shimmering with magic and possibility.

They asked the same questions as their ancestors had generations ago:

> Where did this Loot come from?
>
> What is the meaning of these items?

And like their ancestors, with each new discovery...

* They **learned** about the bags
* As they learned, they **traded, cherished, and protected** the bags
* This learning leads to further epiphanies and **revelations**
* Driven by the power of their discoveries, they worked together to **build and explore**
* Adorned with Loot, they continued on with epic quests and adventures...&#x20;

## And then, a discovery: the Spirits of the items began to reveal themselves

While the Adventurers knew that the Loot items carried special magic and spirits, up until now, they all looked the same...a Katana was the same as another Katana, a pair of Holy Greaves the same as another pair of Holy Greaves.

But then, at Greatness 15, items of certain Spirits (i.e. alignments or powers) begin to emerge ‚Äî a `Katana of Giants`‚Ä¶.a pair of `Holy Greaves of Brilliance`.

Then at Greatness 19, items received ‚Äúnames‚Äù befitting their stories and battles in which they were used ‚Äî a ‚Äú`Demon Peak‚Äù Katana of Giants`‚Ä¶.a pair of `‚ÄúBender Bite‚Äù Holy Greaves of Brilliance`

And then at Greatness 20 the items received the +1s.

{% endhint %}

## And then, **a societal change: the emergence of the 16 Orders**

At first quietly in the corners of dark rooms and the edges of minds...and then with intensity.

As the Greatness of the items grew, so did their unique Spirits and powers, manifested onto the items in the form of the Orders:&#x20;

_‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî> `of Fury, of Brilliance, of the Twins, of Anger`, etc_

The magnetic pull and the subtle alignment that the Adventurers had only felt in their hearts was now imprinted directly on the items, plain as day!

Clans and sects and groups were formed around the 16 Orders, creating factions and divisions and allegiances.&#x20;

Adventurers of each Order honed their unique powers, especially those who carried any of the Genesis Loot items, still passing them from generation to generation.

{% endcontent-ref %}

## The Adventurers of the 16 Orders split up across the Realms, and a new global map took shape

The societal structure morphed to one in which 16 groups organized themselves into different areas of the [Realms](../../../canonical-principles/realms/), and aligned around the unique Spirits of their Order.

{% endcontent-ref %}

### And so it went, for generations

* There were wars and peace
* Societies rose and fell
* Demons and dragons abounded
* Lovers fought, families grew
* The 16 Orders strengthened their alignments and fortified their Realms
* Technology advanced in unexpected, diverse directions
* Over time, all of these magically-powerful Loot items were passed from father to son, from mother to daughter, from brother to brother, mixed all together and revered

## `Space for infinite stories to be told`

`Within this meta-storyline of the Age of Exploration, there is room for infinite stories of adventure and exploration.`&#x20;

`Big stories and small stories.`&#x20;

`Epic battles and small conflicts in dark rooms.`&#x20;

`Stories of families, of characters, of love and hope, of loss and disillusion, and everything in between.`
{% endhint %}

## And then....a **SHATTERING, a CATACLYSM, a FLASH**

{% hint style="success" %}
`This "cataclysmic event" is wide open for interpretation and storytelling.`

`‚Ä¢¬†It may have been self-inflicted`

`‚Ä¢¬†It may have to do with demons and dragons`

`‚Ä¢¬†It may have been a climate event`

`‚Ä¢¬†Maybe it was a result of the Adventurers channeling the dark magic of Loot bag distillation, and something went wrong`
{% endhint %}

There is terror and destruction across the Realms.

Most Adventurers dropped where they lay, disintegrated to dust.

Loot bags were left and were lost ‚Äî under bridges, in ditches, in crypts, and in caverns.&#x20;

Some adventurers survived, but most perished.

## Some take shelter in the Divine City

Of those who survived, some adventurers took shelter in the [Divine City](../../../the-lootverse/lootverse-projects/divinedao.md)

They safeguarded as many of the stories and history and sacred texts of the Lootverse, and locked the gates with Divine magic.

## The Mist began to swirl.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

_Thus begins the era of ‚ÄúThe Mist‚Äù_

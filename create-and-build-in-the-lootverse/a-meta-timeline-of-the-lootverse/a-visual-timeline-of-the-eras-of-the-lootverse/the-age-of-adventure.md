# The Age of Adventure

## **And this is where we are now in the timeline (and in reality)**

* _Starting to find a way to coordinate together_
* _Starting to work as an “organization”_
* _Starting to pool our resources_
* _Starting to align on foundational concepts_

## We are in the 3rd Cycle of Loot

* We find 8k bags of [og-loot.md](../../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/og-loot.md "mention")
* There is a **frenzy** (`and we lived through that Loot frenzy!!`)
* We **learn** about the bags.
* As we learn, we **trade, cherish, and protect** the bags.
* **This learning leads to an epiphany —** [<mark style="background-color:yellow;">There is structure in the contract</mark>](../../../canonical-principles/loot/a-revelation.md)!
  * `16 Orders!`
  * `The existence of the Genesis Adventurers!`
  * `Item levels!`
  * `Three Character Classes / item specializations!`
  * `The names!`
  * `Greatness!`
  * `Lore A/B/C!`

## A further revelation: the existence of Lootverse timeline and the "Genesis Adventurers"

* Through analysis and collaboration, we looked inside the bags and items and contract, and discovered the existence of a first generation of "Genesis Adventurers" — Adventurers who carried the 2,540 [genesis-loot.md](../../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/genesis-loot.md "mention") bags, perfect bags with items all of the same Order
  * See the [math and analysis here](https://medium.com/@timshelxyz/the-genesis-project-for-loot-timshels-discovery-dddb50ab18b7) that led to the discovery of the [the-16-orders](../../../canonical-principles/loot/the-16-orders/ "mention") and the 2,540 [genesis-loot.md](../../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/genesis-loot.md "mention") bags.

### How the 2540 Genesis Loot bags are created and manifested back into the present day timeline

* From our 8,000 [og-loot.md](../../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/og-loot.md "mention") bags, we discovered the ability to distill the essence of the "spirits" out of the most ancient items of the Lootverse (the Greatness 15+ items) and distill those spirits into "Genesis Mana"\

* Upon collecting a perfect set of 8 Genesis Mana from a single Order, corresponding to all 8 item types (i.e. weapon, head armor, chest armor, etc), players can **summon the spirit** of a Genesis Adventurer and receive its [Genesis Loot Bag](https://opensea.io/collection/genesisadventurer).\

* We are _<mark style="background-color:red;">not</mark>_ literally resurrecting physical **Genesis Adventurers** back to the present day
* We _<mark style="background-color:green;">are</mark>_ summoning their spirits and manifesting their physical [genesis-loot.md](../../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/genesis-loot.md "mention") bags back to the present day.
  * These are real, physical bags, that exist in the present day and are of course now "in our wallets."&#x20;
  * The bags aren't Genesis Adventurers — they are bags once _carried_ by Genesis Adventurers.\

* **What's in the Genesis Loot bags?**
  * The items in the bags are effectively copies of the items we found in the [og-loot.md](../../../welcome-to-loot/what-is-loot/og-loot.md "mention") bags, brought back through time to today's physical world.

### Through the Genesis Loot bags, we have opened a connection to the past and can hear whispers of the stories of the Adventurers who once carried these bags

{% hint style="success" %}
This a story device to help with world-building, because now through these Genesis Loot bags, we can start to tell the ancient stories of the Lootverse with credibility and specificity.
{% endhint %}

## **And now with OG Loot and Genesis Loot in our wallets, we've become Adventurers ourselves — and we’re building, together:**

Driven by the magnetic power of Loot and our collective inspiration and energy, we are working together to **build the Lootverse**

And soon, armed with the items from our Loot bags, WE have begun to set out on quests and adventures...and just like those who came before us, we have become **Adventurers** again.

## Just a few examples of things we are building together:

* Building an [Atlas of the Lootverse](../../../the-lootverse/the-lootverse-atlas.md)
* Discovering the [ancient texts and history of Loot that’s been stashed away in the Divine Library](https://genesisproject.xyz/north-star-vision/genesis-scrolls)&#x20;
* Opening the doors to [Hyperloot](../../../the-lootverse/lootverse-projects/hyperloot.md)
* Going on exploratory missions with [Loot Explorers](../../../the-lootverse/lootverse-projects/loot-explorers.md) and creating lore
* Raiding [Crypts](../../../the-lootverse/lootverse-projects/the-crypt.md)
* Building [Realms pillaging games, Tower defense games](../../../canonical-principles/realms/)…
* Higher fidelity games/content/experiences from across the Lootverse timeline&#x20;
* And so much more....

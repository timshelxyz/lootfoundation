# ðŸ““ The Cycles of Loot

### The story of Loot is a story of discovery, decentralized action and collaborative world-building, across thousands of generations.

It is a story of <mark style="background-color:purple;">**cycles**</mark> and <mark style="background-color:purple;">**building**</mark> and <mark style="background-color:purple;">**iterative learning**</mark>.

## Each cycle:

* We find bags of Loot
* We learn about the bags
* As we learn, we trade, cherish, and protect the bags
* This learning leads to an epiphany or a revelation
* Driven by that revelation, we work together to build
* With these Loot items, we become "Adventurers"
* Carrying the items, we set out on quests and adventures...
* And the cycle repeats

## We are in the 3rd known cycle of Loot...
